    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>At WinzSpin, we value the privacy of our users. We do not collect any personal information that can identify you. The app does not require users to input their name, email address, or any other personal data. The only requirement for using the app is a basic internet connection, which is necessary to load the app’s functionality. Since we don’t collect any personal details, we cannot access, store, or share any sensitive user data. This ensures that you remain anonymous while using the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>WinzSpin is designed to be a safe and accessible app for users of all ages, including children under the age of 13. However, the app does not collect any personal information, even from children, making it inherently compliant with child privacy protection laws. We recommend that parents or guardians supervise their children while using the app, as no personal data is collected or stored during the use of the app. The app’s primary function, spinning, requires only an internet connection and does not gather any data related to a user’s activity, ensuring a safe experience for children.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions and Security</h2>
    <p>We respect the privacy of our users and do not request unnecessary permissions on your device. The app does not need access to any sensitive information such as your contacts, location, or camera. The only requirement to use the app is an internet connection, which is used solely to load the app and ensure that you can spin the wheel. Since the app does not collect, store, or share any personal data, there is no risk of data breaches or misuse. We make sure that your experience is secure and private at all times.</p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WinzSpin does not incorporate any third-party services such as analytics, advertisements, or tracking tools. This means that no data is sent to external parties for analysis, advertising, or any other purpose. Since no third-party tools are used, we can guarantee that your personal data, including your browsing behavior and activity within the app, remains private and secure. We do not share your data with any external companies or services, ensuring that your information stays with you at all times.</p>

    <h2>5. Updates to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>As part of our commitment to transparency, we may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this page. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy. However, as we do not collect personal data, changes to the privacy policy will likely be related to clarifications, regulatory compliance, or any changes in app functionality that may affect privacy in the future. Our primary goal remains to ensure your data privacy remains intact.</p>
